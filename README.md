# tfs_dnn
C++ Deep Neural Net library - Under initial development, please ignore this project for the moment.



This implementation was inspired by a Java Script library called ConvNetJS by Andrej Karpathy.

I hope that you have fun with this library.  I have developed it as I learned about DNNs.

Please let me know if you have found it useful.
